    "summary": "The Nifty 50 extended losses for the second straight session on November 6, slipping a third of a percent as key technical and momentum indicators turned weaker. Experts now see the index heading towards 25,450, with a further decline to 25,300 possible if that level is breached. Meanwhile, weak global cues are weighing on sentiment — Wall Street ended sharply lower overnight as AI-driven stocks resumed their slide, dragging the Nasdaq down nearly 2 percent. U.S. layoff data for October also spiked to a two-decade high, adding to jitters. Asian markets are mirroring the overnight weakness, and the GIFT Nifty signals a subdued start for Indian equities. Among stocks in focus today: Bajaj Auto, Hindalco, Trent, Divi’s, and Nykaa are set to report earnings, while Bharti Airtel, TVS Motor, Lupin, and Akzo Nobel will also be in the spotlight. In the IPO space, Pine Labs opens for subscription.

Momentum indicators now hint at short-term caution following October’s sharp rally. However, experts say the broader trend stays positive as long as the index holds above the 25,500–25,400 support zone. A breakdown below this range could give bears the upper hand, while sustained strength above it may pave the way for a rebound toward 25,900–26,000, with a key hurdle at 26,100. Autos will be in focus after a record October sales print, while four Nifty heavyweights — Titan, Tata Consumer, Power Grid, and Bharti Airtel — are set to announce their earnings. Meanwhile, the IPO rush continues with Groww and Pine Labs preparing to hit the Street this week.

Positive cues have lifted sentiment during the two-day gap — US President Donald Trump’s Diwali celebration at the White House and his statement that India will reduce Russian oil purchases mark a softer diplomatic tone compared to his earlier remarks. Adding to the optimism are reports of potential H-1B visa relief, putting IT stocks in focus today. On the earnings front, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) will announce its Q2 results.\n\nCatch Nandita Khemka in conversation with Chandan Taparia, Senior Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Technical Research at Motilal Oswal, and Anand K.

    "summary": "After a healthy three-day rally, the Nifty 50 has smartly broken past its falling resistance trendline and the June swing high, closing above 25,700 with a 0.5% gain on October 17 — just in time for the Diwali week celebrations. Experts say the index now looks poised for a strong bull run. A sustained close above the October 2024 bearish gap at 25,740 could open the gates to 26,000–26,300, levels last seen in September 2023. On the downside, immediate support stands at 25,500. GIFT Nifty hints at a gap-up start, and with the bulls extending their party after last year’s 2% gains, stocks like RIL, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, IndusInd and RBL Bank will be in focus. Catch Nandita Khemka in conversation with Ruchit Jain, Vice President – Technical Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, and Nikhil Khandelwal, MD, Systematix Group, as they decode market trends and top festive stock ideas for Samvat 2082.",
