Experts now see the index heading towards 25,450, with a further decline to 25,300 possible if that level is breached. Meanwhile, weak global cues are weighing on sentiment — Wall Street ended sharply lower overnight as AI-driven stocks resumed their slide, dragging the Nasdaq down nearly 2 percent. U.S. layoff data for October also spiked to a two-decade high, adding to jitters. Asian markets are mirroring the overnight weakness, and the GIFT Nifty signals a subdued start for Indian equities. Among stocks in focus today: Bajaj Auto, Hindalco, Trent, Divi’s, and Nykaa are set to report earnings, while Bharti Airtel, TVS Motor, Lupin, and Akzo Nobel will also be in the spotlight. In the IPO space, Pine Labs opens for subscription.
